# Eventie
## Description
This web application is designed to help event organizers manage event registration and attendance tracking in a more efficient and organized way. With this application, event organizers can create events, register users to events, and mark users as participated using QR codes.

### Features
- Event Creation: With this application, event organizers can easily create and set up events by providing event details such as event name, description, date, and time.

- User Registration: Event organizers can allow users to register for events by providing basic information such as name, email address, and phone number.

- Attendance Tracking: The application allows event organizers to track attendance by scanning the QR code of the registered users. This helps to ensure that only registered users are allowed to attend the event and also helps to keep track of attendance during the event.

## Setup
#### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

1. Install appwrite according to [official guide](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation). If you use a custom port or hostname for appwrite, make sure to replace `localhost` with `[HOST]:[PORT]` in following instructions.
2. Visit `http://localhost` and follow the instructions. Create a new project and a new user.
3. Create a new file called `.config.js` in `/PROJECT_ROOT/backend/.config.json`  with following attributes:

```js
const config = {
    PORT: 3456, // port to run backend application
    ENDPOINT: 'http://localhost/v1', // appwrite endpoint
    PROJECT: 'project id', // project id
    API_KEY: 'api key', // your api key from appwrite console
};

export default config;
```

Project id can be found in Project Overview page in Appwrite console.
